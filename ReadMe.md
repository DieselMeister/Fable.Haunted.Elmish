# a UseElmish Hook for Haunted


Basically I used the code from Zaid Ajaj from the useElmish extension of Feliz and modified it a very little to use in Haunted.

So big thanks to Zaid (https://github.com/Zaid-Aja).

And also a big thanks to Angel Munoz for the Fable.Haunted package. (https://github.com/AngelMunoz/Fable.Haunted)

You are both awesome!
